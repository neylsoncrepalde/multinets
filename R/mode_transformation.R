#' 2-mode to 1-mode transformation
#'
#' This function is a wrapper to the \code{\link[igraph]{bipartite_projection}}
#'   function from the 'igraph' package. It transforms a bipartite (2-mode)
#'   network to two 1-mode networks. It is recommended to use it as an analysis
#'   tool for a bipartite network that was obtained from
#'   \code{\link{extract_mesolevel}}.
#'
#' The function counts 1 edge when two vertices of the
#'   higher level share a vertex of the lower level and 1 edge when two vertices
#'   of the lower level are affiliated to the same vertex in the higher level.

#' @param x a bipartite graph object. Data must be bipartite and must not
#'   be multilevel
#' @param which one of "both", "high" or "low". High indicates to do the
#'   transformation to the higher level. Low indicates to do the transformation
#'   to the lower level. Both returns a list with both networks.
#'
#' @return If which is set to "both" (default), returns a list with two
#'   generated networks. If which is set to "high" or "low", returns a graph
#'   object.
#'
#' @examples
#' # First, extract the mesolevel of the multilevel network
#' affiliation <- extract_mesolevel(linked_sim)
#'
#' # To obtain both transformed networks
#' transformed <- mode_transformation(affiliation)
#'
#' # To obtain just one transformed network
#' high_transformed <- mode_transformation(affiliation, which = "high")
